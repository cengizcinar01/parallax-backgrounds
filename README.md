# Parallax Backgrounds

This project showcases a parallax scrolling effect using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It demonstrates the creation of a dynamic and visually appealing background with multiple layers moving at different speeds, creating a sense of depth in a 2D environment.

## Features

-   **Multiple Parallax Layers:** Implements five distinct background layers that move at different speeds, enhancing the depth perception.
-   **Dynamic Speed Adjustment:** Users can interactively adjust the speed of the parallax effect through a slider control.
-   **Seamless Looping:** Background layers seamlessly loop, providing a continuous scrolling effect.
